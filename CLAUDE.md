# AgentOps Skills Repository

## Zero-Context Startup (Read First)

If this is your first message in a fresh session, orient in this order:

1. `docs/newcomer-guide.md` for a practical repo orientation and learning path.
2. `docs/README.md` and `docs/INDEX.md` for navigation.
3. `README.md` for product-level framing.
4. Task-specific canonical surfaces:
   - CLI behavior: `cli/cmd/ao/`, `cli/internal/`, generated `cli/docs/COMMANDS.md`
   - Skills behavior: `skills/**/SKILL.md`
   - Hooks/gates: `hooks/hooks.json` and `hooks/*.sh`
   - Contracts/schemas: `schemas/**`, `lib/schemas/**`
5. `.agents/AGENTS.md` for knowledge store navigation (search on demand, don't pre-load).

## Source-of-Truth Precedence

When files disagree, trust in this order:

1. Executable implementation and generated outputs (`cli/**`, `hooks/**`, `scripts/**`, `cli/docs/COMMANDS.md`)
2. Declared contracts/manifests (`skills/**/SKILL.md`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `schemas/**`)
3. Narrative docs (`docs/**`, `README.md`)

Always report mismatches; do not silently pick a lower-precedence doc over executable behavior.

## Project Structure

```
cli/          Go CLI (ao binary) — cmd/ao, internal packages
skills/       Skill definitions (source of truth)
hooks/        Git/session hooks
lib/          Shared shell helpers
scripts/      Release, validation, and maintenance scripts
schemas/      JSON schemas for config/manifest
tests/        Integration and validation tests
bin/          Standalone shell tools
docs/         Documentation
```

## Critical: Skill File Locations

**Skills source of truth is `skills/` in THIS repo.**

When editing skills, ALWAYS edit the files under `skills/` in this repo. NEVER edit `~/.claude/skills/` directly — those are installed copies that get overwritten on `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/main/scripts/install.sh)`.

```
CORRECT:  skills/evolve/SKILL.md          (this repo — source of truth)
WRONG:    ~/.claude/skills/evolve/SKILL.md (installed copy — do not edit)
```

## Building the CLI

```bash
cd cli && make build        # Build ao binary to cli/bin/ao
cd cli && make test         # Run tests
cd cli && make lint         # Run linter
cd cli && make sync-hooks   # Sync embedded hooks/skills into cli/embedded/
```

## Key Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/pre-push-gate.sh` | Smart pre-push validation (`--fast` for diff-based) |
| `scripts/ci-local-release.sh` | Local release validation gate (run before tagging) |
| `scripts/sync-skill-counts.sh` | Sync skill counts across docs after adding/removing skills |
| `scripts/generate-cli-reference.sh` | Regenerate CLI docs after changing commands/flags |
| `scripts/regen-codex-hashes.sh` | Regenerate hashes after changing skills-codex/ files |

## CI Validation

All pushes to `main` run `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (24 jobs). **Run checks locally before pushing.**

### Quick Local Validation

```bash
scripts/pre-push-gate.sh --fast          # Recommended: diff-based conditional checks
cd cli && make build && make test         # If you changed Go code
cd cli && make sync-hooks                 # If you changed hooks/ or lib/hook-helpers.sh
scripts/regen-codex-hashes.sh            # If you changed skills-codex/ files
scripts/pre-push-gate.sh                 # Full gate (all 33 checks, ~3min)
```

### Rules That Break CI

**No symlinks.** Ever. The plugin-load-test rejects all symlinks in the repo. If you need the same reference file in multiple skills, **copy** it.

**Skill counts must be synced.** Adding or removing a skill directory requires:

```bash
scripts/sync-skill-counts.sh
```

This updates SKILL-TIERS.md, PRODUCT.md, README.md, docs/SKILLS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, and using-agentops/SKILL.md. Forgetting this fails the doc-release-gate.

**Every `references/*.md` must be linked in SKILL.md.** If a file exists in `skills/<name>/references/`, the skill's SKILL.md must contain a markdown link to it or a `Read` instruction referencing it. Use `heal.sh --strict` to check.

**Codex skills are manually maintained.** Edit `skills-codex/<name>/SKILL.md` directly or add overrides in `skills-codex-overrides/<name>/`. Audit drift with `bash scripts/audit-codex-parity.sh --skill <name>`.

**Embedded hooks must stay in sync.** After editing `hooks/`, `lib/hook-helpers.sh`, or `skills/standards/references/`: run `cd cli && make sync-hooks`.

**CLI docs must stay in sync.** After changing commands/flags: run `scripts/generate-cli-reference.sh`.

**Contracts must be catalogued.** Files added to `docs/contracts/` need a link in `docs/INDEX.md`.

**Go complexity budget.** New/modified functions must stay under cyclomatic complexity 25 (warn at 15).

**No TODOs in SKILL.md.** Use `bd` issue tracking instead.

**No secrets in code.** CI greps for hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens in non-test files.

## Testing Rules

See `.claude/rules/go.md` and `.claude/rules/python.md` for language-specific testing conventions. Key rules: L2 integration tests first, L1 unit tests always. No coverage-padding. No `cov*_test.go` naming.

## Release Pipeline

Tag triggers GoReleaser + GitHub Actions: `git tag v2.X.0 && git push origin v2.X.0`. **Always run `scripts/ci-local-release.sh` before tagging.** Retag with `scripts/retag-release.sh v2.X.0`.

## Agent Goals

GOALS.md is the strategic intent layer consumed by `/evolve` and `/goals`:
- `ao goals measure` — fitness gate checks
- `ao goals measure --directives` — list strategic directives as JSON
- `ao goals steer add/remove/prioritize` — manage directives
- `ao goals init` — bootstrap GOALS.md interactively
- `ao goals migrate --to-md` — convert GOALS.yaml → GOALS.md

## AgentOps Workflow (RPI)

```
Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
    ↑                            │
    └──── Knowledge Flywheel ────┘
```

## Session Constraints

- **Multi-phase work:** Route through `ao rpi` (enforces timeouts and stall detection).
- **Before spawning workers:** Verify no file overlap across the wave. File collisions are the #1 swarm failure mode.
- **Before proposing new capability:** Check `ao rpi serve --help`, `hooks/hooks.json`, and `GOALS.md` first.
- **Gas City (gc) bridge:** `cli/cmd/ao/gc_bridge.go`, `gc_events.go`, `rpi_phased_gc.go`. Do not write new tests or features for deprecated files (`rpi_loop_supervisor.go`, `rpi_c2_events.go`, `rpi_phased_tmux.go`, `rpi_workers.go`, `rpi_parallel.go`, `fire.go`).

### Execution Discipline

- **Verify before committing.** Go: `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`. Python: run relevant tests. Never commit unverified code.
- **First-Edit Rule.** First Edit/Write/Bash must happen within your first 3 responses. Execute first, research second.
- **Intent Echo.** Before non-trivial tasks, state in ONE sentence what you understand. Wait for confirmation on multi-file changes.
- **Two-Correction Rule.** If corrected twice on the same task: STOP, re-read, state what you now understand differently, and confirm before trying again.
